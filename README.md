# bar-tomas-api
Official API for the Bar Tom√°s F.C.

## Installation

Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:

    python -m venv venv

Activation for Windows users:

    ./venv/Scripts/activate

Activation for Mac and Linux users:

    source venv/bin/activate

If using VS Code, select the virtual env in the tab at the bottom, and simply
open a new terminal, where you'll see something like `(venv)` at the beginning
of the command line.

Once activated, we can go ahead and install the necessary dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

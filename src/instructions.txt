* REQUIREMENTS *

- Python 2.7 installed (for gcloud)
- gcloud SDK installed
- Python 3.x installed (for development)
- Flask installed (for the development server)


* INSTRUCTIONS *

1. All required third-party libraries must be included in "requirements.txt". 
(As I use App Engine, the commons are 'jinja2' and 'flask', and also, if using
any Google API, 'google-auth').
Afterwards, we run this command (either within a virtuaenv or not):

pip install -r requirements.txt

* Note that 'pip' must be the Python 3.x version, so maybe its 'pip3'

That will install the libraries on your local computer, and automatically in
the App Engine production environment when the app is deployed.

2. To run the app locally (as in a dev server), we need to execute this in CMD:

set FLASK_APP=main.py
flask run

* if you don't set the FLASK_APP flag, flaks will look for app.py
* if you want to select a specific host and/or port, you can run: 
flask run --host:0.0.0.0 --port 8080

3. To deploy the app to App Engine, we have to navigate to the 'src' folder and 
execute the following:

gcloud init
(login, select the project, etc... (no need to setup Compute Engine))
gcloud app deploy
